# Quiz

This is a fun application that has a few questions and a timer. When the timer is up the user is able to enter a user name to save the high score. I wasn't able to get that working, but I wanted to turn in what I had done so far. I think that I am very close, but I just couldn't figure it out. 

I achieved what I have with the help of my tutor Anthony and watching the youtube video https://youtu.be/riDzcEQbX6k  , and the website  https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/   .

The questions were cut and pasted from href: https://www.funtrivia.com/trivia/SciTech/Software-and-Programming-5518_3.html
